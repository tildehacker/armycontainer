# armycontainer
A minimalistic field based dependency injection container.

## Why I built this container
I built this container to learn how to inject dependencies into fields using
reflection and annotations.

Building such a container is explained in more details in this
[blog post](https://tildehacker.com/building-field-based-dependency-injection-container).
